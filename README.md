# Well-Wisher Uncle ü§ì

## Basic Details

**Team Name:** [MINUTES]

**Team Members:**
- Lakshmi Krishna V R - [Saintgits College Of Engineering]
- Mohammed Faiz - [Saintgits College Of Engineering]

**Project Description:**  
Well-Wisher Maaman is a Chrome extension designed to keep you away from distractions like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. If you spend too much time (e.g., 10 minutes) scrolling, an irritating uncle (Maaman) will appear on your screen. He will keep pestering you with funny but guilt-inducing dialogues until you finally leave the distracting site and get back to work. You cannot close the interruption until you answer all questions. Finally, Maaman will redirect you to a productive site.

**The Problem:**  
When we try to study, it feels like the whole world is on a mission to distract us ‚Äîfriends calling, family asking for ‚Äújust one small favor,‚Äù notifications buzzing. Our focus shatters every few minutes.
But the moment we open social media? Magically, no one disturbs us. We can sit in the same spot for hours, scrolling endlessly, laser-focused on memes, reels, and random videos we didn‚Äôt even plan to watch.
It‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôve mastered the art of focus‚Ä¶ just on the wrong thing.

**The Solution:**  
We created a Chrome extension that kicks in whenever you spend more than your set limit on any social media platform. Instead of just giving you a boring ‚Äútime‚Äôs up‚Äù alert, it pops up a virtual Indian maaman (uncle) on your screen, ready with an endless supply of nosy, irritating, and hilariously personal questions (typical indian maaman questions).  the kind that make you want to close your laptop out of sheer frustration. And once you finally quit scrolling, it redirects you to a random useful website you probably never knew existed, turning wasted time into something a little more productive.
