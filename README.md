Well-Wisher Maaman
Stay focusedâ€”or face the wrath of Maaman!

Well-Wisher Maaman is a Chrome extension designed to keep you away from distractions like social media.
If you spend too much time scrolling, an irritating uncle (Maaman) will suddenly appear on your screen.
He will keep pestering youâ€”chatting, scolding, and reminding youâ€”until you finally decide to leave the distracting site and get back to work.

âœ¨ Features
Real-time Distraction Detection â€“ Automatically triggers when you spend too long on supported social media sites.

Persistent Maaman Mode â€“ Once he appears, he wonâ€™t leave until you close the site.

Humorous but Annoying Dialogues â€“ Keeps you amused but also slightly guilty.

Customizable â€“ You can adjust time limits and add/remove platforms.
