Project Name: Well-Wisher Maaman
This Chrome extension is designed to keep you focused. If you spend too much time on social media platforms, an “irritating uncle” (Maaman) will appear on your screen. 
He’ll persistently engage and pester you until you decide to quit the platform and return to your work.
True to his name, the Well-Wisher Maaman only wants the best for you—by steering you away from distractions and back toward productivity.
